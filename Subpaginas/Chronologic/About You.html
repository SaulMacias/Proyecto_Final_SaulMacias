          Well, I'm a big girl with cash and wheels<br />
          I'm taller than you when I don't wear heels<br />
          And I don't give a damn, don't give a damn about<br />
          You'll never know how to deal with me<br />
          Big trouble inside when I hit the spot<br />
          I like to hang out, lay down my block<br />
          And I don't give a damn, don't give a damn about you<br /><br />

          Still, will you let me, will you let me over?<br />
          'Cause your high heels take me higher<br />
          So your talk won't take me under<br />
          Now, can you give me one night to keep me over?<br />
          So I can take you higher<br />
          As the world goes up in fire<br /><br />

          But I'm a tough girl, don't need anybody<br />
          Not a gold digger, not a sugar baby<br />
          I don't give a damn, don't give a damn about<br />
          You'll never know how to deal with me<br />
          Still wanna play the game, I won't be the loser<br />
          Everyone knows I would never choose ya<br />
          I don't give a damn, don't give a damn about you<br />
          Can't find a proper way to please me<br /><br />

          Can you help me?<br />
          And if the car comes equipped with a moon roof<br />
          Then the stars will shine and help with the mood we're in now<br />
          I can't help the way I feel<br />
          'Cause I never said that my love was foolproof<br />
          But you know that I know that you love me too, now<br /><br />
