          I remember lord<br />
          Remember lord<br />
          Come along<br /><br />

          Was driving my fifty<br />
          I've seen a line on my way<br />
          Nothing to say<br />
          Yes, I'm feeling guilty<br />
          Was on my high bar<br />
          I'm losing ground, anyway<br /><br />

          I'm setting up my own shame<br />
          Bring me back my old flame<br />
          Or I'll be long gone, love me world<br />
          Just not getting used to<br />
          All the things I push through<br />
          I feel unplugged, know my word<br /><br />

          I was up ahead, no one could've chased me<br />
          Going high speed, didn't feel that fame would change me<br />
          Facing old fears, am I gonna stay here?<br />
          Losing more sleep<br />
          Surely gonna die before I wake<br />
          I was up ahead, no one could've chased me<br />
          Going high speed, didn't feel that fame would change me<br />
          What a lifetime, nothing lasts forever<br />
          All is gone now, should've seen it coming my way<br /><br />

          I remember lord<br />
          Remember lord<br />
          Come along<br /><br />

          I see how much they miss me<br />
          Writing lines every day, nothing to say<br />
          Yes, I'm feeling guilty<br />
          I'm aiming so far<br />
          Was feeling awesome, anyway<br /><br />

          I'm setting up my own shame<br />
          Bring me back my old flame<br />
          Or I'll be so gone, love me world<br />
          Even trying the voodoo<br />
          Seeing what I could do<br />
          Can't hold a flood, no more world<br /><br />

          I was up ahead, no one could've chased me<br />
          Going high speed, didn't feel that fame would change me<br />
