        <p>
          Now I haven't eaten all day, how am I gonna do this man?<br />
          Yeah don't wait for her man, don't wait for her<br />
          I'll tell you what man: Come with me now and you know<br />
          I'll get you some lunch, I'll hook you up with something<br />
          I got a little bank, y'know, no problem<br />
          I hear you, that's cool (alright? It's cool)<br />
          Man, can't you guys just wait here about a half hour, man?<br />
          Yo I'll be back man, I'm just gonna munch up a little bit man, I'm
          pretty hungry<br />
          Yo, let him come back<br /><br />

          Here you will find food for your body<br />
          As well as comfort for your troubled mind<br />
          I'd really like some soup (bread and butter)<br />
          Of course my friend, what happened to your hand?<br />
          Oh, food at last!<br /><br />

          How did they get here?<br />
          Regular storage procedure, the same as the other food<br />
          What other food?<br />
          Fish (food) protein (fast for ya)<br /><br />

          Now what happened?<br />
          Well, the cop got<br />
          The next morning I went to the store to get some food<br />
          (Bread and butter) they arrested me<br />
          I'll save you (thank you)<br />
          Would you like a snack?<br />
          Thanks for the drink<br /><br />

          Operation doomsday complete<br />
          All your intercoms casualty and damage testing<br /><br />

          Enough! You talk of the people's rights<br />
          The people have only those rights which I choose to give them<br />
          And that's for their own good, believe me<br />
          I do, doom<br />
          They disappoint me, they must work faster<br />
          But the prisoner<br />
          Ah yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against
          me<br />
          Watch him, I have special plans for that one<br /><br />

          Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped<br />
          Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap<br />
          I suggest you change your diet<br />
          It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it<br />
          Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease<br />
          It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze<br />
          Take the easy way out phony, until then<br />
          They know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen<br />
          So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this<br />
          They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen injustice<br />
          Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet<br />
          Two batteries, some brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it<br />
          He be better off on pc glued<br />
          And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood<br />
          Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed<br />
          (Food, we need food!)<br /><br />

          He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh<br />
          A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous<br />
          Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit<br />
          They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit<br />
          Her bra smell, his card say: Aw hell!<br />
          Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel<br />
          Keep a cooker where the jar fell<br />
          And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell<br />
          Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears<br />
          Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares<br />
          The odd pair swears and God fears<br />
          Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years<br />
          I wrote this note around new year's<br />
          Off a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares?<br />
          Enough about me, it's about the beats<br />
          Not about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat<br />
          A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical<br />
          Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral<br />
          It's a miracle how he get so lyrical<br />
          And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual<br />
          For a mil', do a commercial for mello yello<br />
          Tell them devils: Hell no, sell y'all own jello<br />
          We Hollow Krills, she swallow pills<br />
          He follow flea collar three dollar bills<br />
          And squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal<br />
          Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal<br />
          Twirl a l after every meal (food!)<br /><br />

          What up? To all rappers: Shut up with your shutting up<br />
          And keep a shirt on, at least a button-up<br />
          Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?<br />
          Out-of-work jerks since they shut down Chippendales<br />
          They chippin' nails, doom tippin' scales<br />
          Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales<br />
          This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail<br />
          Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale<br />
          Light the doobie till it glow like a ruby<br />
          After which, they couldn't find the villain, like Scooby<br />
          He's in the lab on some old Buddha monk shit<br />
          Overproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?<br />
          Punk, try and ask why ours be better<br />
          Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater<br />
          Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude<br />
          (We need food!)<br />
