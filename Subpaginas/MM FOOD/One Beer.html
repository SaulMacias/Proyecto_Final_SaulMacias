        <p>
          I get no kick from champagne<br />
          Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all<br />
          So tell me why shouldn't it be true?<br />
          I get a kick out of brew<br /><br />

          There's only one beer left<br />
          Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf<br />
          Tempt me, do a number on the label<br />
          Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table<br />
          Like: It's on me, put it on my tab, kid<br />
          However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it<br />
          You're leaving on your face, forfeit<br />
          I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it<br />
          Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it<br />
          She told him: Get off it, and a bunch of other more shit<br />
          Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads<br />
          It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds<br />
          It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off<br />
          Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough<br />
          They group been soft<br />
          First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off<br />
          He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road<br />
          She asked him autograph her derriere, it read<br />
          To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd<br />
          Love, Villain, take pride in code words<br />
          Crooked eye, mold, nerd, geek with a cold heart<br />
          Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart<br />
          Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy<br />
          No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye<br />
          And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel<br />
          The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel<br />
          They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed<br />
          How is only one left? The pack comes in six<br />
          Whatever happened to two and three?<br />
          A herb tried to slide with four and five<br />
          And got caught like: What you doing, G?<br />
          Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy<br />
          Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me<br />
          Looser than a pair of Adidas<br />
          I hope you brought your spare tweeters<br />
          MCs sound like cheerleaders<br />
          Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin<br />
          DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'<br />
          He do it for the smelly hubbies<br />
          Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies<br />
          Few can do it, even fewer can sell it<br />
          Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet<br />
          He plots shows like robberies<br />
          In and out, one, two, three, no bodies, please<br />
          Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt<br />
          The mic is the shotty: Nobody move, nobody get hurt<br />
          Bring heat like the boy done gone to war<br />
          He came in the door, and: Everybody on the floor!<br />
          A whole string of jobs like we on tour<br />
          Every night on the score, coming to your corner store<br /><br />

          There, it is done<br />
          Now that the representative from South Africa has been<br />
          Mind programmed<br />
          All of the world leaders on earth are under my control<br />
          And when they meet tomorrow in special session<br />
          I, DOOM, shall be voted: Master of the World<br />
          My plan is foolproof, but just in case<br />
          And what about snow?<br /><br />

          Now you keep your eyes open<br />
          When I tell ya, start snappin' (oh, yeah, sure)<br />
          Uh, ladies und gentlemen<br />
          I am risking my life to tell you with, with great concern<br />
          That I must warn you, I, I<br />
          You must listen<br />
          Many among you, have, have had their minds taken over<br />
          (What a story, start snappin')<br />
          DOOM, gosh, I wish I'd brought my autograph book<br />
          (Your attempts at humor bore me) Right, lead-head<br />
          You're weird<br />
          Why is everyone staring at us?<br />
          (Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)<br />
          Relax masseur, just do your thing<br />
          (Get a good grip on my)<br />
          What? Why, I'll bend your read-out meter for ya, you little<br />
          (Hey, knock it off, Ben)<br />
          What's the matter? (Oh, Ben)<br />
          You're nothing but a chicken-head<br />
          (You overgrown granite-head) Hold it<br />
