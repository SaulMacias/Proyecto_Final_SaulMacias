        <br />
        <p>
          Darker than the East River, larger than the Empire State<br />
          Where the beast who guard the barbed wire gate<br />
          Is on the job, not my fate, tired of the wait<br />
          Till the Villain bring deliverance from the dire straits<br />
          Fire at a higher rate, why debate the liars?<br />
          Fliers scatter, buy a plate, isolate the wires<br />
          Try the straight pliers, if not the vice grips<br />
          A real price-saver way to acquire nice whips<br />
          What a steal for real on wheels of steel<br />
          Stunner, a funner summer number-one meal deal-bummer<br />
          A bizarre phenomenon is your armor on?<br />
          Take your cash, Karma, or break your fast, Ramadan<br />
          Transaction drama, aw, come on, Barney<br />
          Clack, clack, pardon me, whack rap con carne<br />
          He came to feed the childrens like Sally Struthers<br />
          After that, he's going back to Cali, where's the (love is)<br />
          Wilder than the Nile, hold power like the great pyramids<br />
          Of Giza, and stay leanin' like the tower of Pisa<br />
          Give him something he can feel that's soft to squeeza<br />
          Raw with the pen, and on the mic, off the hezza<br />
          Get shot off that wide-eyed talk<br />
          And if he had a pot, he'd still piss on the sidewalk<br />
          Can't take the street out the street-person<br />
          Lookin' for the perfect beat, coercion into heat-burstin'<br />
          They couldn't spot him on the spot date<br />
          Got the only tape that come with a free hot-plate<br />
          Whoever do get to see me sing<br />
          With the 3 D-ring sittin' stationary like B.B. king<br />
          Can see how it really sting, it ain't no front row<br />
          Standing room only at the motocross stunt show<br />
          The ruckus ain't up to Snuffleupagus<br />
          Me and Sub' is like the brown Smothers Brothers (My love is)<br />
          Vaster than the seven seas, bigger than Mount Kilimanjaro<br />
          If they don't know, fill 'em in tomorrow<br />
          On the horror show, a mental note: Return Bob's record<br />
          Swear to God, before he gets a job, he robs an Eckerd<br />
          Blessed with a hot flow, tested, it got dough<br />
          Invested in stress, the best to finesse an opto<br />
          As I reminisce, never forgot when I was very broke<br />
          Shot the Henny straight, couldn't afford to cop the Cherry Coke<br />
          Or should I say, broke with wealth?<br />
          To know enough to give them just enough rope to yoke they self<br />
          Plan B before I take the ring and pawn it<br />
          The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it<br />
          Dog-gone it, do the statistics<br />
          How he bust lyrics it's too futuristic for ballistics<br />
          And far too eccentric for forensics<br />
          I dedicate this mix to Subroc, the hip-hop Hendrix<br /><br />

          In my pocket, a note<br />
          It's from my father<br />
          From the guard's whip, is this a trick?<br />
          Why would I resort to trickery? You're already a prisoner<br />
          What do I gain by deceiving you?<br />
          You can't blame me for being suspicious. No<br />
