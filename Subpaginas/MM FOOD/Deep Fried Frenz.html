          Before we go any further<br />
          Friend<br />

          As you call 'em, they call you when they need something<br />
          Trees for the blunt, the g's for the front<br />
          I found a way to get piece of mind for years<br />
          And left the hell alone, turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone<br />
          Send me a letter, or better, we could see each other in real life<br />
          Just so you could feel me like a steel knife<br />
          At least so you could see the white of they eyes<br />
          Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies<br />
          Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies<br />
          Close, but really don't know me<br />
          Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies<br />
          Some come around when they need some money<br />
          Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies<br />
          Fam be around whether you paid or bummy<br />
          You could either ignore this advice, or take it from me<br />
          Be too nice and people take you for a dummy<br />
          So nowadays he ain't so friendly<br />
          Actually, he woulda even made a worthy enemy<br />
          Read the signs: "No feeding the baboon"<br />
          Seeing as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds<br />
          Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance<br />
          Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance<br />
          Never let your so-called mans know ya plans<br />
          (How many of us have them?) A show of hands<br />
          (Friends) Is a term some people use loosely<br />
          I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see<br />
          You telling me, I try to act broke<br />
          Jealousy the number one killer among black folk<br />
          Fellas be under some type of spell, like crack smoke<br />
          Ghetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc<br />
          Just another way a chick'll lead to your end<br />
          I check the dictionary for the meaning of friend<br />
          It said: person, one who likes to socialize with<br />
          Sympathizer, helper, and that's about the size of it<br />
          Most of the time these attributes is one-sided<br />
          To bolster the crime, they apt to shoot you through your eyelid<br />
          And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch<br />
          Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch<br />
          (Click!) and when things get quiet<br />
          Catch 'em like a thief in the night (bow!) what a riot<br />
          I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal<br />
          Don't let it get drastic, think of how ya moms'll feel<br />
          When it get for real, the steel get to sparking<br />
          Everything darken, and ain't no talking<br />
          For somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble<br />
          Ya better off focusing than tryin to plot to bubble<br />
          Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is<br />
          (One's we can depend on, friends!)<br />
          Some come in the form of co-dependence<br />
          Alotta times only end up bein co-defendants<br />
          Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence<br />
          And leave you up under the jail, beggin' for a penance<br />
          It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?<br />
          Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty<br />
          I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory<br />
          (How many of us have) a similar story<br />
          (Friends!)<br />
          Before lovers we used to have some type of overstanding<br />
          Just so when I let her get the man thing, she know its no strings<br />
          We could do the damn thing, but ho it's no rings<br />
          Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again?<br />
          That depends on how good was the skins<br />
          And could she memorize the lessons, it ain't no need to pretend<br />
          Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they just friends<br /><br />

          (Friends<br />
          How many of us have them?<br />
          Friends<br />
          Ones we can depend on?<br />
          Friends<br />
          How many of us have them?<br />
          Friends<br />
          Before we go any further)<br /><br />

          Fellas! Don't be silly! I know who my friends are!<br />
          And the next nice neighborhood I move into, you guys'll get
          crackin'<br />
