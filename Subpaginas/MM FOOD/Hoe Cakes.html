          Keep your hoes in check<br />
          (Super!)<br /><br />

          I got this girl and she wants me to duke her<br />
          I told her I'd come scoop her around 8, she said (Super!)<br />
          That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper<br />
          No matter what I need her to do, she be like (Super!)<br />
          Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa<br />
          On the microphone he flossed the ring (Super!)<br />
          Average emcees is like a TV blooper<br />
          MF DOOM, he's like DB Cooper<br />
          Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit<br />
          Just to cool her off, she said: Niggas ain't about shit<br />
          I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it<br />
          The way it be in her mouth she can't live without it<br />
          And can't live with this, handle your business<br />
          Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list<br />
          One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper<br />
          It's fun smacking rookies, he is the (Super!)<br />
          Look like a black wookiee when he let his beard grow<br />
          Weirdo, brown-skinned'd, always kept his hair low<br />
          Rumor has it it's a S-Curl accident<br />
          DOOM was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent<br />
          Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent<br />
          A lot of guys wonder where they stacks went<br />
          I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla<br />
          Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her<br />
          No matter the city she with me to do the thang-thang<br />
          Work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang<br />
          Same name on the titty as on the name ring<br />
          Pretty like Baby D off All in the Same Gang<br />
          Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her<br />
          But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut<br />
          And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa<br />
          Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the (Super!)<br />
          See most cats treat her like Foofur<br />
          Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the (Super!)<br />
          You need to make her feel cuter<br />
          And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be (Super!)<br />
          Do for her, keep her in a new fur<br />
          So she look sweet when she go to meet the (Super!)<br />
          Got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it<br />
          Put it in the air, come here, kiss it<br />
          Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you<br />
          When she's on the rag, never let her fry the Ragu<br />
          Which'll have you under some type of spell crying dag boo<br />
          Her name on your back in a tattoo<br />
          Whether a bougie broad, nerd ho, street chick<br />
          Don't call her Wifey if you met her at the Freaknik<br />
          You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll duke her<br />
          And be a father to your child like the (Super!)<br />
          He keep his hoes in check<br />
          Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks<br />
          Tell 'em: Take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real<br />
          Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal<br />
          Find out where he keep the Tec and the blue steel<br />
          Make sure for extra wreck, let him know how you feel<br />
          And while he's running down to All-Star Weekend to ball<br />
          I'm coming with the U-Haul (Super!)<br /><br />

          Has the laser cannon been loaded?<br />
          Everything has been prepared as you ordered<br />
          But how did you get permission to return to New York, Master?<br />
          Through the efforts of a misguided fool<br />
          It's free enterprise!<br />
          And I'm not gonna let some blasted government bureaucrat tell me how
          to run my business<br />
          But DOOM-<br />
          Will be my guest on my private estate on Long Island!<br />
          There's nothing you can do about it<br />
          He's dangerous, I just hope you know what you're doing<br />
          Don't I always? Ah, there's DOOM's jet, right on time<br /><br />

          Why is it so cold down here?<br />
          The heat went out in the whole building<br />
          Warm enough out there on Long Island with DOOM<br />
          DOOM? Here in New York?<br />
          Yes, DOOM, has an amazing new machine<br /><br />

          Get the President of the United States on the phone<br />
          How long's all this gonna take, DOOM?<br />
          I would not advise you to repeat that error<br />
          Sure, I know what you mean<br />
