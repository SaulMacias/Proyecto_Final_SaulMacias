        <br />
        <p>
          I strive to be humble, lest I stumble<br />
          Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with its mumbo<br />
          Sauce, Tyson is a fowl holocaust<br />
          Hitler gassed your whole head up with poultry, I'm fed up<br />
          Ignore cordon bleu, stand up, get up<br />
          Lunge for your knife, don't forget your potholders<br /><br />

          What, these old things? About to throw 'em away<br />
          With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ<br />
          Usually I take them off with Oil of Olay<br />
          MCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay<br />
          Hot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?<br />
          Working on a way that we can roll away tinted<br />
          Some say the price of holding heat is often too high<br />
          You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy<br />
          The one that's too fly to eat shoo pie<br />
          Never too busy when it comes down to you and I<br />
          (Swear to God) a lot of niggas wish to die<br />
          They need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry<br />
          You're on the list, if not, pick a number spot<br />
          Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat<br />
          I coulda had a V-8<br />
          F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight<br />
          Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy<br />
          That night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie<br />
          So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted<br />
          Take it from the fire side, it won't get blistered<br />
          Got it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit<br />
          These metal fingers be holding<br /><br />

          When I was four, I penned: God Was Born In New York<br />
          Back in '77, still got nan in the crescent<br />
          The effervescence of God's presence is thick<br />
          Unlike vapor, Esther Rolle, extra raw, word to the baker<br />
          Peace to the hardworkin' gingerbread makers<br />
          Looked her up and down, said: Hmm, too much makeup<br />
          Poor music taste, ten years from being grown up<br />
          Rappers don't blow up, heads do (aww, shit)<br />
          My name is Dwight Spitz, I'm a Sonic addict<br />
          I use to think it was merely a nagging habit<br />
          Born under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine<br />
          I strive to flip it into fine wine<br />
          Barely born a virgin, is what the stars said<br />
          Black not white, red all over, though, like Elmo<br />
          Twenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking<br />
          I make music every weekend<br />
          It's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love<br />
          I get mad love, but I detest the labor<br />
          And its wages, you know, death?<br />
          I'm servin' life from this gift of God<br />
          Don't forget your potholders, my niggas<br /><br />
