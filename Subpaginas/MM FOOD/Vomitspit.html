        <p>
          It's the beat (DOOM), he hear it in his sleep sometimes<br />
          Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes<br />
          Real rhymes not your everyday hologram<br />
          Even when ribs was touchin', never swallowed the ham<br />
          He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad<br />
          It might need salt like your man's bland ballad<br /><br />

          A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell you's<br />
          Blues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose<br />
          Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly<br />
          Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy<br />
          Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy<br />
          Always threw me off when she told me: Daddy, funk me<br />
          I'm like: Anywho's<br /><br />

          Seeds walkin' all out in the street without any shoes<br />
          I guess it's better than some funky socks<br />
          You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox
          (hahahahaha)<br />
          Instead she wanna hear the beatbox<br />
          Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock<br /><br />

          Sing it, bring it, back to your laboratory<br />
          While he's in his oratory, glorious like a horror story<br />
          The mask is like Jason<br />
          They told the place not to let the basket type case in<br />
          He could be some kind of wacko<br />
          Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho<br /><br />

          He busted in, blessed be the Lord<br />
          Who believe any mess they read up on a message board<br />
          If so, I got bridges for the low low<br />
          Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo<br />
          Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier<br />
          Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear<br />
          It was the shit when I first scooped it<br />
          At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid<br /><br />

          Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly<br />
          Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy<br />
          Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty<br />
          Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty<br />
          Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated<br />
          In deep theta, let her hate, the creep played her<br />
          Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data<br />
          Say he stay self medicated to sleep later<br />
          Side effects is similar to sugar pill<br /><br />

          Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ew<br />
          And made his exit on some calm shit<br />
          Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit<br />
          (DOOM!)<br />
