        <p>
          It's horrible<br />
          One lonely evening alone, home<br />
          End up with carpal tunnel syndrome<br />
          And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches<br />
          Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes<br />
          Supposed to be checking emails<br />
          All I got is messages from ass naked females<br />
          I don't know a Jenny<br />
          She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny<br />
          And that's the last time I saw her<br />
          But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah<br />
          And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out<br />
          And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts<br />
          I wonder what I owe her<br />
          For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa<br />
          (Nite nite!) Uh, okay honey, sweet dreams<br />
          Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans<br />
          A metal handful, wipe it on the quilt<br />
          Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk<br />
          Locked in, looking at your picture<br />
          Fully clothed winter and I'm right there with ya<br />
          Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone<br />
          A man could only wish you do the same till he get home<br />
          Fat chance, at least he get snacks<br />
          That'd have to do till a brother get back<br />
          Until then smack One-Eyed Jack<br />
          And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack<br />
          That's three different flavors<br />
          Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry wafers<br />
          Acting all hard, 'bout to get beat up<br />
          I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up<br />
          Soon as he fell off the beat down<br />
          All I hear is: 13th cell, put the sheet down<br />
          Damn CO, what the hell do she know?<br />
          Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low<br />
          A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen<br />
          Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again<br />
          In the wee hours, he's gotten farther<br />
          Needing three showers, being hot and bothered<br />
          The wiz with her legs bent, pregnant<br />
          God bless the day she wondered where her egg went<br />
          I need a L, it's hard to drink without it<br />
          And could use some kookies but trying not to think about it<br />
          Watching BET on jazz for knowledge on file<br />
          Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild<br />
          Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch<br />
          Like we got for lunch, chocolate fudge butter crunch<br /><br />

          He don't mess with the Ritz Bits<br />
          Wheat Thins, Saltines or Triscuits<br />
          Matzos or Cheez-Its<br />
          Catch sugar fits every time that he sees<br />
          Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk<br />
          Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk<br />
          Even the Oreos, no matter what weather<br />
          Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together<br />
          In the game he's shameless<br />
          Even uses a code name: Famous Amos<br />
          It's cheaper than a short stay at the Days Inn<br />
          And good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin<br />
          Give a hand to who invented the camera<br />
          Skip past the graham, animal and Grandma's<br />
          Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill<br />
          Or get caught with a handful of cream fill<br /><br />

          Oh, honey! What are you doing? That's so nasty!<br />
          It might seem ill<br />
          Ew! Go wash your hands! (No)<br />
          Kookies<br />
          Get out of here!<br /><br />

          DOOM is master of the world<br />
          I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book<br />
          You've disturbed me for the last time<br />
          Hey, y'know something gang, that DOOM ain't really all bad<br />
          What do you mean, Ben?<br />
          Well, on account of him I had me a real good time<br />
          Y'know, I mean, between you and me I kinda like being black<br />
          Well, maybe if we're lucky he'll attack us once more and send you
          back, Benjamin<br />
          Ah-haha very funny, very very funny<br />
          He must be mad<br />
          Well, if anyone can do it<br />
          Nevertheless let's get out of here, while we can<br />
          Food, we need food<br />
