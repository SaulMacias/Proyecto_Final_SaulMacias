          Give it a sec for the pain to start this wreck right here<br />
          It ain't for the faint of heart<br />
          They thought they saw the worst verse<br />
          From the team of G men who seem like nerds at first<br />
          Once they get to know us people dig us<br />
          Leaders in the fight for equal rights for niggas<br />
          Inventor of the more dementeder flow, no bout a-doubt it<br />
          This go for if you're bout it, bout it or rowdy, rowdy<br />
          Whatever's clever, the master foe<br />
          Who every hooker heard of, but now a ho know<br />
          If we see tomorrow, the next day classes<br />
          The Villain in the back with the x-ray glasses<br />
          Have no fear, the ninja here<br />
          Feel 'em like the tinge in your ear from drinkin' ginger beer<br />
          When it's on, loco head gon' lay low<br />
          And heat it like beef patty, coco bread kon queso<br />
          If you say so, lace the whole case load<br />
          They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show<br />
          He told 'em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's<br />
          His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halos<br />
          Say ho if you never worked a J-O<br />
          And keep more cash in a stash than a peso<br />
          Okay, yo, y'all know who to follow<br />
          Tie 'em up in the crib and leave they place hollow<br />
          Oh, shoot, the goose she's loose<br />
          So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice<br />
          Frown like the first time you taste couscous<br />
          Stash the deuce deuce, troops askin' "truce, truce"<br />
          Today on intense wreck week<br />
          We have the Supervillain in his own defense to speak<br />
          It's all part of my mental techniques<br />
          Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks<br />
          Train a sane brain to an insane train of thought<br />
          On a campaign trail he came to gain your support<br />
          Charge cash for a autograph<br />
          Say some shit to make your daughter laugh, then slaughter the ass<br />
          See 'em on the big screen like Steve McQueen<br />
          Do somethin' and never be back once he leaves the scene<br />
          Keep more medicated pads than Stridex<br />
          For his own side wreck with no known side effects<br />
          Before you press charges use your noodle<br />
          So what when he grab the mic he crush your cute cuticles<br />
          Keep your mouth shut, everything will be beautiful<br />
          It would be awfully rude to you, now get back to your hooty hoo<br />
          Damn it, it ain't worth the drama, can it<br />
          From the calm bandit, eat rhymers like pomegranate<br />
          Soon as he stepped in he lit the room<br />
          Boom, reschedule my noon with Brit Hume<br />
          (DOOM!) In love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing<br />
          Pulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain<br />
          Maintain and say it, don't spray it<br />
          You wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it<br />
          If I had a dime for every rhymer's that bust guns<br />
          I'd have a cool mil' for my sons in trust funds<br />
          When I was broker than a broke dick dog<br />
          I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog<br />
          When it rain, it sure do thunderstorm<br />
          I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms<br />
          One, two, microphone checker<br />
          First learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker<br />
          This is back when he was like crib age<br />
          When he hit the stage, it's like a gauge to the rib cage<br />
          Break the mic like a rock star break a guitar<br />
          And jump off the stage like: Yee haw!<br /><br />

          We shall now vote for a new world leader. I nominate, DOOM<br />
          All in favor, say: Aye<br />
          Aye!<br />
          Oh, no, DOOM, is master of the world<br /><br />

          We must hurry<br />
          Wait! If you are really with us, prove it. Let me hear you say it<br />
          Tell me that DOOM is a tyrant and must be overthrown<br />
          I have spent my life<br />
          Say it! You have spent your life serving a tyrant. DOOM must be
          stopped<br />
          I fear you're right, my friend<br /><br />

          The President of the United States is on the phone<br />
          Mr. President, you're at the mercy of your deadliest enemy<br />
          It is time you learned once and for all, DOOM<br />
          The United States does not barter with terrorists<br />
          You never learn, do you?<br /><br />

          Here, this is the address of friends in New York, they'll help<br />
