          Can't stand a brown-nosing nigga, fake ass bastard<br />
          Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan<br />
          Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest<br />
          My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest<br />
          Street nigga, stamped and bonafide<br />

          True to the ski mask, New York's my origin<br />
          Play a fake gangsta like an old accordion<br />
          According to him, when the D's rushed in<br />
          Complication from the wire, testimony was thin<br />

          So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East<br />
          A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning<br />

          Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men<br />
          Where no brains but gum flap<br />
          He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap (Pap!)<br />
