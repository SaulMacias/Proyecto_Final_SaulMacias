        <p>
          Running desperately low on food, they were forced to turn back<br />
          Well, I'll be!<br />
          What's that villain doing?!<br />
          Wait princess, your voice sounds familiar<br />
          Well, it should, you see, DOOM wants me to marry him<br />
          What?<br />
          But after seeing what he has done to our peaceful world, I despise
          him<br />
          He intends to destroy all of us if I persist in refusing him, even
          now!<br /><br />

          Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill<br />
          Met a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills<br />
          All thirty three nerves, controlling my curves<br />
          Common sense just swerved every time I got served<br />
          Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric<br />
          Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit<br />
          Thought it was love like, sent from above, you not a soulmate<br />
          More ways and actions of a primate<br />
          Who by low and census coming faker than extensions<br />
          Pissed away all good intentions, outta here sister was missin'<br />
          Intuition, maybe it was me, I couldn't see<br />
          Holding onto fantasy, getting bitten by reality<br /><br />

          War wound, purple heart, love veteran<br />
          Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine<br />
          Anything just to forget the hurt<br />
          Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt<br />
          On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind<br />
          And the POW's get left behind<br />
          Mentally scarred for life, love is war<br />
          And some chicks are just too hard to wife<br /><br />

          I shoulda deaded it from genesis instead of hittin' the Guinnesses<br />
          Now I'm free falling, cursing at the street, bawling<br />
          He ceased calling, no appetite for feast darling<br />
          So deep all in, I bet he never stop balling women<br />
          Forsake God for the sin of a man<br />
          Sacrifice a whole life for a slice, overstand?<br />
          Maybe it's a lack of pigment, loneliness imagine figment<br />
          Only got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it<br />
          Damn Jody, comin with the okie doke, pokie poke<br />
          Steady rockin boats, got me aimin for ya throats<br />
          Sniper scope, weren't we supposed to elope?<br />
          Propose then ya froze, I don't think that I can cope<br /><br />

          War wound, purple heart, love veteran<br />
          Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine<br />
          Anything just to forget the hurt<br />
          Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt<br />
          On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind<br />
          And the POW's get left behind<br />
          Mentally scarred for life, love is war<br />
          And some chicks are just too hard to wife<br /><br />

          Constant frustration, stemming from a no-win situation<br />
          Rushing lust and fornication adding to the complication<br />
          Patience is a virtue, pain run deep when love desert you<br />
          Listenin' to whisperin', choosing chaos over discipline<br />
          Simpleton, life should really be a piece of Entenmann's<br />
          Relationships strengthening, flower essence: Penstemon<br />
          Gentlemen, my favorite shit, so I've never forsaken it<br />
          I persevere, make it fit, sculpting and reshaping it<br />
          Taking sips off a fifth of it, passionate<br />
          Intense, incense candles lit, scandalous<br />
          Emotional bandages, why would he abandon this?<br />
          Guess he couldn't handle it, the boss is magnanimous<br /><br />

          War wound, purple heart, love veteran<br />
          Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine<br />

          Look! There, ya see<br />
          Oh, boy here we go!<br />
          How come all you, college boys wear them faggotty-looking white
          shoes<br />
          I don't car<br />
          They look funny as hell<br />
          Stop!<br />
          Ah, yes, looks like she got burnt laces<br />
          You didn't wash your neck, sometimes we don't wash our necks, but
          that's ok<br />
          Oh, I washed my neck. Take a look at my neck<br />
          Hold it right there, you!<br />
          Where you're going there are no jokes<br />
          Aw, boy! I'm beginning to think that armor-plated Gargoyle doesn't
          like me<br />
