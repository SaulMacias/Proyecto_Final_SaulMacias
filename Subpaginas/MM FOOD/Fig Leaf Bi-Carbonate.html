          Well anyway<br />
          You may be saying about now<br />
          How in the world is that old fella eat all of that crazy stuff<br />
          And not get sick to his stomach?<br />
          Haha, well, don't worry about that<br />
          You see, whenever I make a pig of myself on the filet<br />
          Or the pudding or something<br />
          I mix up some herbs and<br />
          I come up with a dandy glass of this<br />
          Bicarbonate of fig leaf<br />
          That'll set me free, I'll tell you<br /><br />

          Edible wrappers may be in grocery stores as soon as months from now<br />
          You've heard of good to the last drop<br />
          Well your food could soon be good to the last bite<br /><br />

          Wow! That was loud!<br />
          Got to ya, huh?<br /><br />

          Here's an interesting note: Artificial colors<br />
          Yellows or Reds<br />
          Let's focus on the red<br />
          In addition to FD&C Red Number 40<br />
          The FDA has approved certain food coloring additives, some are
          actually poison!<br />
          If you aren't sure of the additives or colorings in the products
          you've purchased<br />
          Leave it alone!<br />
          Poison!<br />
          Bad news!<br />
          That's right!<br /><br />

          Thank you<br />
          Well, I think that about covers all of the natural foods out here<br />
          Now then, I have to go take my dessert here<br />
          I have to go<br />
          I'm conducting a cooking class today<br />
          Good health to you all!<br />
          Uh, over this way<br />
          Look out!<br /><br />

          Alright Pops, still feel like charging me for that meal?<br /><br />

          One look at his feature-less face<br />
          One look was enough to ensure his safety<br />
          As years passed, he became even more bitter and angry<br />
          Burning with vengeance against the world<br />
          Finally, amidst hidden scrolls, he found what he'd been seeking<br />
          Then, clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor<br />
          And possessing the world's greatest secrets of science and magic<br />
          He returned to his homeland<br />
          And there he has remained<br />
          Scheming, dreaming, planning<br />
          Plotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world<br />
          (I can't believe it!)<br />
          (Alright, alright, don't make a big deal about it)<br />
          I warn you DOOM, you've gone too far<br />
          (Yeah!)<br />
          That'll do it DOOM, get your machine<br />
