          When you got the yams (what's the yams?)<br />
          The yam is the power that be<br />
          You can smell it when I'm walking down the street<br />
          (Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)<br />
          I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer<br />
          What the fuck happened?<br />
          (Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell<br />
          But most of you share bars like you got<br />
          the bottom bunk in a two man cell<br />
          (A two man cell)<br />
          Something's in the water (something's in the water)<br />
          And if I got a brown nose for some gold then<br />
          I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller<br /><br />
