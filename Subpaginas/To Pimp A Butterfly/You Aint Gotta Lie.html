          Study long, study wrong, nigga<br />
          Hey, y'all close that front door<br />
          Ya'll let flies in this motherfucker<br />
          Close that door!<br />
          My og up in this motherfucker right now<br />
          My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool<br />
          Hey, hey, babe check it out, imma tell<br />
          You what my mama had said, she like:<br /><br />

          I could spot you a mile away<br />
          I could see your insecurities written all on your face<br />
          So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say<br />
          Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang<br />
          With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same<br />
          Circus acts only attract those that entertain<br />
          Small talk, we know that it's all talk<br />
          We live in the laugh factory every time they mention your name<br /><br />

          Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me<br />
          Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me<br />
          Say you got the burner stashed to impress me<br />
          It's all in your head, homie<br />
          Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me<br />
          Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me<br />
          Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me<br />
          You sound like the feds, homie<br /><br />

          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie<br />
          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta try so hard<br />
          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie<br />
          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta try so hard<br /><br />

          And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you<br />
          But you think it's all love<br />
          And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done<br />
          Reputation can't protect you if you never had one<br />
          Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)<br />
          Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)<br />
          The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex<br />
          Let me put it back in proper context<br /><br />

          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie<br />
          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta try so hard<br />
          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie<br />
          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta try so hard<br /><br />

          Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me<br />
          Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me<br />
          Say you got the burner stashed to impress me<br />
          It's all in your head, homie<br />
          Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me<br />
          Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me<br />
          Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me<br />
          You sound like the feds, homie<br /><br />

          What do you got to offer?<br />
          Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin<br />
          Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit<br />
          Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is<br />
          Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie<br />
          This is for fugazie niggas and bitches<br />
          Who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts<br />
          You can never persuade me<br />
          You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them<br /><br />

          Or you, the truth you love to bend<br />
          In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho<br />
          On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though<br />
          So loud, rich niggas got low money<br />
          And loud, broke niggas got no money<br />
          The irony behind it is so funny<br />
          And I seen it all this past year<br />
          Pass on some advice we feel:<br /><br />

          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie<br />
          You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br />
          You ain't gotta try so hard<br />
