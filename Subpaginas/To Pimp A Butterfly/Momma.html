          Oh shit!<br />
          Oh, I need that<br />
          I need that sloppy<br />
          That sloppy<br />
          Like a chevy in quicksand<br />
          Yeah<br />
          That sloppy<br /><br />

          This feelin' is unmatched<br />
          This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap<br />
          Black ball cap<br />
          (West, west, west)<br />
          We don't share the same synonym fall back<br />
          (West, west, west)<br />
          Been in it before internet had new acts<br />
          Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack<br />
          My innocence limited the experience lacked<br />
          Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked<br /><br />

          The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact<br />
          You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic<br />
          Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards<br />
          Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction<br />
          Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest<br />
          Gamblin' benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic<br /><br />

          Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion<br />
          Winnin' in every decision<br />
          Kendrick is master that mastered it<br />
          Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?<br />
          Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic<br />
          Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque<br />
          But what's better than that?<br />
          The fact it brought me back home<br /><br />

          We been waitin' for you<br />
          Waitin' for you<br />
          Waitin' for you<br />
          Waitin' for you<br /><br />

          I know everything, I know myself<br />
          I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health<br />
          I know fatality might haunt you<br />
          I know everything, I know compton<br />
          I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything<br />
          I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors<br />
          I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma<br />
          I know everything, I know history<br />
          I know the universe works mentally<br /><br />

          I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me<br />
          I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money<br />
          I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery<br />
          I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies<br />
          I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition<br />
          The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision<br /><br />

          I know you know that lines from compton school district<br />
          Just give it to the kids, don't gossip about how it was distributed<br />
          I know how people work, I know the price of life<br />
          I know how much it's worth, I know what I know and I know it well<br />
          Not to ever forget until I realized I didn't know shit<br />
          The day I came home<br /><br />

          We been waitin' for you<br />
          Waitin' for you<br />
          Waitin' for you<br />
          Waitin' for you<br /><br />

          I met a little boy that resembled my features<br />
          Nappy afro, gap in his smile<br />
          Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd<br />
          Run a number on man and woman that crossed him<br />
          Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted<br />
          Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles<br />
          Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'<br /><br />

          He looked at me and said kendrick you do know my language<br />
          You just forgot because of what public schools had painted<br />
          Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous<br />
          I used to watch on channel 5, tv was takin'<br />
          But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it<br />
          It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor<br />
          Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress<br /><br />

          And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil<br />
          You spoiled by fantasies of who you are<br />
          I feel bad for you<br />
          I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you<br />
          If you resist, I'll back off go catch a flight or two<br />
          But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace<br />
          Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially<br />
          To come back home<br /><br />

          This is a world premiere<br />
          This is a world premiere<br />
          This is a world premiere<br /><br />

          I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite<br />
          For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?<br />
