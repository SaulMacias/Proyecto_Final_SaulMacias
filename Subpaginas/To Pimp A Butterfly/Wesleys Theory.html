        <p>
          Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star<br />
          Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star<br />
          Every nigga is a star, ayy<br />
          Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?<br /><br />

          Hit me!<br />
          When the four corners of this cocoon collide<br />
          You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive<br />
          Gather your wit, take a deep look inside<br />
          Are you really who they idolize?<br />
          To Pimp a Butterfly<br /><br />

          At first, I did love you<br />
          But now I just wanna fuck<br />
          Late nights thinkin' of you<br />
          Until I get my nut<br />
          Tossed and turned, lesson learned<br />
          You was my first girlfriend<br />
          Bridges burned, all across the board<br />
          Destroyed, but what for?<br /><br />

          When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool<br />
          Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room<br />
          Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies<br />
          Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey<br />
          I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues<br />
          Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four<br />
          Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring<br />
          Married to the game and a bad bitch chose<br />
          When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap<br />
          Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap<br />
          Take a few M-16s to the hood<br />
          Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?<br />
          I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House<br />
          Republican run up, get socked out<br />
          Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck<br />
          Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that<br /><br />

          We should never gave<br />
          We should never gave niggas money<br />
          Go back home, money, go back home<br />
          We should never gave<br />
          We should never gave niggas money<br />
          Go back home, money, go back home<br />
          (Everybody get out)<br /><br />

          At first, I did love you (love you)<br />
          But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)<br />
          Late nights thinkin' of you (of you)<br />
          Until I get my nut (till I get my nut)<br />
          Tossed and turned, lesson learned<br />
          You was my first girlfriend<br />
          Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)<br />
          Destroyed, but what for?<br /><br />

          Yo, what's up? It's Dre<br />
          Remember the first time you came out to the house?<br />
          You said you wanted a spot like mine<br />
          But remember, anybody can get it<br />
          The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker<br /><br />

          What you want you? A house or a car?<br />
          Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?<br />
          Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog<br />
          Motherfucker, you can live at the mall<br />
          I know your kind (that's why I'm kind)<br />
          Don't have receipts (oh, man, that's fine)<br />
          Pay me later, wear those gators<br />
          Clich√©? Then say: Fuck your haters<br />
          I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you<br />
          Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you<br />
          But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you<br />
          Because you make me live forever, baby<br />
          Count it all together, baby<br />
          Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby<br />
          Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides<br />
          So you better cop everything two times<br />
          Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes<br />
          Too much ain't enough, both we know<br />
          Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list<br />
          Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick<br />
          And when you hit the White House, do you<br />
          But remember, you ain't pass economics in school<br />
          And everything you buy, taxes will deny<br />
          I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five<br /><br />

          Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (it's quite a drop, drop,
          drop)<br />
          Lookin' good when you're on top (we're on top together)<br />
          You got a medal for us<br />
          Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria<br />
          Look both ways before you cross my mind<br /><br />

          We should never gave<br />
          We should never gave niggas money<br />
          Go back home, money, go back home<br />
          We should never gave<br />
          We should never gave niggas money<br />
          Go back home, money, go back home<br /><br />

          Tax man comin', tax man comin'<br />
          Tax man comin', tax man comin'<br />
          Tax man comin', tax man comin'<br />
          Tax man comin', tax man comin'<br />
