          Alls my life I has to fight, nigga<br />
          Alls my life I<br />
          Hard times, like: God!<br />
          Bad trips, like: Yeah!<br />
          Nazareth, I'm fucked up<br />
          Homie, you fucked up<br />
          But if God got us, then we gon' be alright<br /><br />

          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          We gon' be alright<br />
          Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br />
          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          Huh? We gon' be alright<br />
          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br /><br />

          Uh, and when I wake up<br />
          I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut<br />
          But homicide be looking at you from the face down<br />
          What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?<br />
          Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life<br />
          Painkillers only put me in the twilight<br />
          Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight<br />
          Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows<br />
          20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me<br />
          Reaping everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy<br />
          No preliminary hearings on my record<br />
          I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence, for the record<br />
          Tell the world I know it's too late<br />
          Boys and girls, I think I gone cray<br />
          Drown inside my vices all day<br />
          Won't you, please, believe when I say?<br /><br />

          Wouldn't you know<br />
          We been hurt, been down before<br />
          Nigga, when our pride was low<br />
          Lookin' at the world like: Where do we go?<br />
          Nigga, and we hate po-po<br />
          Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'<br />
          Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door<br />
          My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow<br />
          But we gon' be alright<br /><br />

          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          We gon' be alright<br />
          Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br />
          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          Huh? We gon' be alright<br />
          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br /><br />

          What you want you: a house or a car?<br />
          40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?<br />
          Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog<br />
          Motherfucker, you can live at the mall<br />
          I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal<br />
          I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero<br />
          Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal<br />
          Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you<br />
          Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you<br />
          In the presence of your chico, ah!<br />
          I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel<br />
          If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you<br />
          Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all<br />
          Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all<br />
          I rap, I black on track so rest assured<br />
          My rights, my wrongs, I write 'til I'm right with God<br /><br />

          Wouldn't you know<br />
          We been hurt, been down before<br />
          Nigga, when our pride was low<br />
          Lookin' at the world like: Where do we go?<br />
          Nigga, and we hate po-po<br />
          Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'<br />

          My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow<br />
          But we gon' be alright<br /><br />

          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          We gon' be alright<br />
          Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br />
          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          Huh? We gon' be alright<br />
          Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
          Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br /><br />

          I keep my head up high<br />
          I cross my heart and hope to die<br />
          Lovin' me is complicated<br />
          Too afraid, a lot of changes<br />
          I'm alright, and you're a favorite<br />
          Dark nights in my prayers<br />
