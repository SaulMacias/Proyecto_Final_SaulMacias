          What money got to do with it<br />
          When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?<br />
          I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it<br />
          Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit<br />
          Hol' up<br />
          Get it back<br />
          I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it<br />
          Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?<br /><br />

          If I was the president<br />
          I'd pay my mama's rent<br />
          Free my homies and them<br />
          Bulletproof my Chevy doors<br />
          Lay in the White House and get high, Lord<br />
          Who ever thought?<br />
          Master take the chains off me<br /><br />

          Life can be like a box of chocolate<br />
          Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious<br />
          Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it<br />
          Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive<br />
          I can just alleviate the rap industry politics<br />
          Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant<br />
          The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious<br />
          Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges<br />
          Be all you can be, true, but the problem is<br />
          A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it<br />
          Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this<br />
          I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal<br />
          K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god<br />
          Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged<br />
          But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET
          Awards<br />
          You lookin' at artists like the harvests<br />
          So many Rollies around you and you want all of them<br />
          Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry<br />
          I should've listened what my grandmama said to me<br /><br />

          Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga<br />
          Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass<br />
          Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga<br />
          Oh now, slow down<br /><br />

          And once upon a time in a city so divine<br />
          Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga<br />
          He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid<br />
          Took his homie to the show and this is what they said<br /><br />

          Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?<br />
          The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips<br />
          The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor<br />
          Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for<br />
          Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?<br />
          One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist<br />
          My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it<br />
          It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?<br />
          No more livin' poor, meet my .44<br />
          When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor<br />
          Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers<br />
          But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey<br />
          Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay<br />
          But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA<br />
          Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?<br />
          Well that's me at these awards<br />
          I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy<br />
          She said<br /><br />

          Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga<br />
          Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass<br />
          Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga<br />
          Oh now, slow down<br /><br />

          And once upon a time in a city so divine<br />
          Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga<br />
          He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused<br />
          Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse<br />
          You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the
          homie<br />
          Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey<br />
          Hollywood's nervous<br />
          Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service<br />
