        <p>
          Loving you is complicated<br />
          I place blame when you steal<br />
          Place shame when you steal<br />
          Feel like you ain't shit<br />
          Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself<br />
          Breakin' on marble floors<br />
          Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours<br />
          But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special<br /><br />

          What can I blame him for<br />
          Nigga I can name several<br />
          Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'<br />
          A baby inside, just a teenager, where's your patience<br />
          Whats your antennas, where is the influence you speak of<br />
          You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her<br />
          I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader<br />
          I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you<br />
          The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you<br />
          Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication<br />
          Thought money would change you, made you more complacent<br />
          I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it<br />
          I swear<br /><br />

          Loving you is complicated<br />
          Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof<br />
          I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me<br />
          Yes I hate you too<br /><br />

          House keeping<br />
          House keeping<br />
          ¡Abre la puerta! ¡abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!<br />
          ¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡<br />
          !Disculpe!<br /><br />

          Are you the reason why mama and them leavin'<br />
          No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it<br />
          I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it<br />
          Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it<br />
          Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out<br />
          You was deserted, where was your antennas again?<br />
          Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?<br />
          You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend<br /><br />

          A friend never leave compton for profit or leave his best friend<br />
          Little brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him<br />
          Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches<br />
          You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven<br />
          You even faced time instead of a hospital visit<br />
          You should thought he would recover, well<br />
          The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real<br />
          Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed"<br />
          You ain't try<br /><br />

          I know your secrets nigga<br />
          Mood swings is frequent nigga<br />
          I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga<br />
          I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga<br />
          Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga<br />
          And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep<br />
          Bitch everything is your fault<br />
          Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend<br />
          Because you shook as soon<br />
          As you knew confinement was needed<br /><br />

          I know your secrets<br />
          Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'<br />
          And that time you, I'm bout to hurl<br />
          I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you<br />
          You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof<br />
          Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago<br />
          You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago<br />
          And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go"<br />
          And if I told your secrets<br />
          The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness<br />
