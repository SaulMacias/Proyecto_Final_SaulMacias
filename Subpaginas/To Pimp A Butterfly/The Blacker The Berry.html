        <p>
          Everything black, I don't want black<br />
          I want everything black, I ain't need black<br />
          Some white, some black, I ain't mean black<br />
          I want everything black<br /><br />

          Six in the mornin', fire in the street<br />
          Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see<br />
          And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain<br />
          It's such a shame they may call me crazy<br />
          They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'<br />
          But homie, you made me<br />
          Black don't crack, my nigga<br /><br />

          I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015<br />
          Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean<br />
          Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses<br />
          You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it<br />
          I'm African-American, I'm African<br />
          I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village<br />
          Pardon my residence<br />
          Came from the bottom of mankind<br />
          My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide<br />
          You hate me don't you?<br />
          You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture<br />
          You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey<br />
          You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me<br />
          And this is more than confession<br />
          I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion<br />
          I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it<br />
          You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'<br />
          You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga<br /><br />

          The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice<br />
          The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice<br />
          The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice<br />
          The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot<br /><br />

          I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black<br />
          Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black<br />
          And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black<br />
          Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks<br />
          How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back<br />
          But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block<br />
          All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black<br />
          Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that<br /><br />

          I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015<br />
          Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean<br />
          I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society<br />
          That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me<br />
          Curse me till I'm dead<br />
          Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave
          in my head<br />
          Institutionalize manipulation and lies<br />
          Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes<br />
          You hate me don't you?<br />
          I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself<br />
          Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt<br />
          Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out<br />
          Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah<br />
          Black and successful, this black man meant to be special<br />
          CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?<br />
          How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?<br />
          You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga<br /><br />

          I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015<br />
          When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree<br />
          This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred<br />
          It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification<br />
          I'm African-American, I'm African<br />
          I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan<br />
          I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius<br />
          Excuse my French but fuck you â€” no, fuck y'all<br />
          That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?<br />
          You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you<br />
          I can tell cause your ways deceitful<br />
          Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle<br />
          Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him<br />
          It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war<br />
          Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy<br />
          Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door<br />
          Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score<br />
          So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers<br />
          Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"<br />
          Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day<br />
          Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays<br />
          Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements<br />
          Or watch BET cause urban support is important<br />
          So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?<br />
          When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?<br />
          Hypocrite!<br />
