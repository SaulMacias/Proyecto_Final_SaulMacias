          The ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it<br />
          Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message<br />
          As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression<br />
          And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:<br /><br />

          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          When shit hit the fan (one two, one two, one two)<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br /><br />

          The ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it<br />
          Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message<br />
          As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression<br />
          And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:<br /><br />

          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your
          friends<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br /><br />

          Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?<br />
          Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?<br />
          Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?<br />
          Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?<br />
          If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off<br />
          If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car<br />
          Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as k. Lamar<br />
          Or question my character and degrade me on every blog<br />
          Want you to love me like nelson, want you to hug me like nelson<br />
          I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome<br />
          You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing<br />
          But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:<br /><br />

          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          The ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it<br />
          Let these words be your earth and<br />
          Moon you consume every message<br />
          As I lead this army make room<br />
          For mistakes and depression<br />
          And if you riding with me<br /><br />

          Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?<br />
          You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?<br />
          You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?<br />
          You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first?<br />
          Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?<br />
          Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?<br />
          Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent?<br /><br />

          How clutch are the people that say they love you and who
          pretending?<br />
          How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show
          forgiveness?<br />
          What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being
          offended<br />
          What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing<br />
          What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it's
          mentioned?<br />
          You wanna love like nelson, you wanna be like nelson<br />
          You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom<br />
          You wanna be remembered that delivered the message<br />
          That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for
          everyone, say<br /><br />

          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          Want you look to your left and right<br />
          Make sure you ask you friends<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          The ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it<br />
          Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message<br />
          As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression<br />
          And if you riding with me<br /><br />

          I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues<br />
          I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you<br />
          That's not nelson-like, want you to love me like nelson<br />
          I went to robben's island analysing, that's where his cell is<br />
          So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me<br />
          Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?<br />
          See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs<br /><br />

          Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow<br />
          Murphy's law, generation x, will I ever be your ex?<br />
          Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit<br />
          Pause, put me under stress<br />
          Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect<br />
          But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall<br />
          How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?<br />
          Is it moses, is it huey newton or detroit red?<br />
          Is it martin luther, jfk, shooter you assassin<br />
          Is it jackie, is it jesse, oh I know, it's michael jackson, oh<br /><br />

          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          That nigga gave us billie jean, you say he touched those kids?<br />
          When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?<br />
          The ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it<br />
          Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message<br />
          As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression<br />
          And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga<br /><br />

          "I remember you was conflicted<br />
          Misusing your influence<br />
          Sometimes I did the same<br />
          Abusing my power, full of resentment<br />
          Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br />
          Found myself screaming in the hotel room<br />
          I didn't wanna self destruct<br />
          The evils of lucy was all around me<br />
          So I went running for answers<br />
          Until I came home<br /><br />

          But that didn't stop survivor's guilt<br />
          Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned<br />
          Or maybe how a-1 my foundation was<br />
          But while my loved ones was fighting<br />
          The continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one<br />
          A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination<br />
          Made me wanna go back to the city<br />
          And tell the homies what I learned<br />
          The word was respect<br /><br />

          Just because you wore a different gang colour than mines<br />
          Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man<br />
          Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these
          streets<br />
          If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us<br />
          But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga‚Äù<br />
          Shit and that's all I wrote<br />
          I was gonna call another nigga but, it ain't really a poem<br />
          I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to<br /><br />

          Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you<br />
          I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa<br />
          About a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground<br />
          What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?<br />
          The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil<br />
          That's how I see it, my word is bon<br />
          I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people<br />
          The poor people is gonna open up this whole world<br />
          And swallow up the rich people<br /><br />

          Cause the rich people gonna be so fat<br />
          They gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying<br />
          Wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry<br />
          You know what I'm saying it's gonna be like<br />
          There might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the
          rich<br /><br />

          Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself<br />
          As somebody that's rich or somebody that made<br />
          The best of their own opportunities?<br />
          I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler<br />
          In every sense of the word. I took nothin', I took the
          opportunities<br />
          I worked at the most menial and degrading job<br />
          And built myself up so I could get it to where<br /><br />

          I owned it. I went from having somebody<br />
          Manage me to me hiring the person that works<br />
          My management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a
          matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made myself a
          millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make
          millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions for the
          record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I
          make millions for us<br />
          And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you
          managed to keep a level of sanity?<br /><br />

          By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all
          good things come to those that stay true. You know what I'm saying,
          and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I
          was noticing, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening.
          So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna
          let them know. I'm finna go straight through<br />
          Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only
          reacts when they back is against the wall?<br /><br />

          I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened
          with resistance it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it
          goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins
          to fight back<br />
          Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we
          fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all
          down<br /><br />

          In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit
          maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you
          still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still
          wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart
          and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you
          don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me you can look
          around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas<br />
          That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you
          left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil
          goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me
          and my generation today?<br /><br />

          Shit, I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and
          next time it's a riot there's gonna be bloodshed for real. I don't
          think america can know that. I think american think we was just
          playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no
          playing. It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be
          like nat turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm
          saying, it's gonna happen<br /><br />

          That's crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is
          music and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it
          is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type
          of energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out
          sometimes<br />
          Because the spirits, we ain't really rappin',<br />
          We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us<br />
          Damn<br />
          I wanted to read one last thing to you<br />
          It's actually something a good friend<br />
          Had wrote describing my world. It says<br />
          ‚ÄúThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it<br />
          Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it<br />
          In order to protect itself from this mad city<br />
          While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways
          to survive<br />
          One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the
          butterfly<br />
          The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the
          beauty within the caterpillar<br />
          But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar<br />
          Sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own
          benefits<br />
          Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar<br />
          Goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him<br />
          He can no longer see past his own thoughts<br />
          He's trapped<br />
          When trapped inside these walls certain ideas<br />
          Start to take roots, such as going home<br />
          And bringing back new concepts to this mad city<br /><br />

          The result?<br />
          Wings begin to emerge, breaking<br />
          The cycle of feeling stagnant<br />
          Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations<br />
          That the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle<br />
          Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely<br />
          Different, they are one and the same."<br />
          What's your perspective on that?<br />
          Pac, pac, pac<br />
