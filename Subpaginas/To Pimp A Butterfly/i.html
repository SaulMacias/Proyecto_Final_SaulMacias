          This is a world premiere!<br />
          This is a world premiere!<br /><br />

          I done been through a whole lot<br />
          Trial, tribulation, but I know God<br />
          Satan wanna put me in a bow tie<br />
          Pray that the holy water don't go dry<br />
          As I look around me<br />
          So many motherfuckers wanna down me<br />
          But an enemigo never drown me<br />
          In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me<br /><br />

          And I love myself<br />
          (The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)<br />
          I love myself<br />
          (But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)<br />
          I love myself<br />
          (He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)<br />
          I love myself<br />
          (One day at a time, sun gonna shine)<br /><br />

          Everybody lookin' at you crazy (crazy!)<br />
          What you gonna do? (what you gonna do?)<br />
          Lift up your head and keep moving (keep moving)<br />
          Or let the paranoia haunt you (haunt you)?<br />
          Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart<br />
          On my sleeve, let the runway start<br />
          You know the miserable do love company<br />
          What do you want from me and my scars?<br />
          Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence<br />
          How many times my potential was anonymous?<br />
          How many times the city making me promises?<br />
          So I promise this<br /><br />

          I love myself<br />
          (The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)<br />
          I love myself<br />
          (But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)<br />

          I love myself<br />
          (One day at a time, sun gonna shine)<br /><br />

          They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street<br />
          And a gun in the hood, and a mob of police<br />
          And a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend<br />
          And a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene yup<br />
          These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation<br />
          I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis<br />
          Dreams of reality's peace<br />
          Blow steam in the face of the beast<br />
          The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now<br />
          The strong in me, I still smile<br /><br />

          I love myself<br />
          (The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)<br />

          I love myself<br />
          (One day at a time, sun gonna shine)<br /><br />

          Walk my bare feet (walk my bare feet)<br />
          Down, down valley deep (down, down valley deep)<br />
          Fi-fie-fo-fum (fi-fie-fo-fum) (I love myself)<br />
          My heart undone (my heart undone)(I love myself)<br /><br />

          I went to war last night<br />
          With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic<br />
          I'ma do it till I get it right<br />
          I went to war last night<br />
          I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent<br />
          Duckin' every other blessin' I can never see the message<br />
          I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave<br />
          From a negative and letting them annihilate me<br />
          And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed<br />
          Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street<br />
          Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free<br />
          Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read<br />
          And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen<br />
          Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"<br /><br />

          I lost my head<br />
          I must've misread what the good book said<br />
          Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside<br />
          Give myself again 'til the well runs dry (i)<br />
