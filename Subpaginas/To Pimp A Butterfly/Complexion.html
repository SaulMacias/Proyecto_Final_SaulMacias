          I'm with this<br />
          Complexion (two-step)<br />
          Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a zulu love)<br />
          Complexion (two-step)<br />
          It all feels the same (it's a zulu love)<br /><br />

          Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun<br />
          Give a fuck about your complexion<br />
          I know what the germans done<br />
          Sneak (dissin')<br />
          Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga<br />
          I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you<br />
          You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down<br />
          Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention<br /><br />

          Complexion (two-step)<br />
          Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a zulu love)<br />
          Complexion (two-step)<br />
          It all feels the same (it's a zulu love)<br />
          Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' sun<br />
          Brown skinned, but your blue eyes<br />
          Tell me your mama can't run<br />
          Sneak (dissin')<br /><br />

          Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga<br />
          I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you<br />
          You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down<br />
          Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention<br />
          So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival<br />
          Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival<br />
          Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken<br /><br />

          By different shades of faces<br />
          Then wit told me, "you're womanless, woman love the creation"<br />
          It all came from God then you was my confirmation<br />
          I came to where you reside<br />
          And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes<br />
          Let the willie lynch theory reverse a million times with...<br /><br />

          Complexion (two-step)<br />
          Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a zulu love)<br />
          Complexion (two-step)<br />
          It all feels the same (it's a zulu love)<br />
          You like it, I love it<br />
          You like it, I love it<br /><br />

          Let me talk my stu scott, 'scuse me on my 2pac<br />
          Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die<br />
          Color of your skin, color of your eyes<br />
          That's the real blues, baby, like you met jay's baby<br />
          You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey<br />
          All my solomon up north, 12 years a slave<br />
          12 Years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark<br />
          I love myself, I no longer need cupid<br /><br />

          And forcin' my dark side like a young george lucas<br />
          Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid<br />
          And frame of mind for them bustas, ain't talkin' “woohah!”<br />
          Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored<br />
          Like two ties, l-l, you lose two times<br />
          If you don't see you beautiful in your complexion<br />
          It ain't complex to put it in context<br />
          Find the air beneath the kite, that's the context<br /><br />

          Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest<br />
          If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed<br />
          Ain't no stress, jigga boos wanna be<br />
          I ain't talkin' jay, I ain't talkin' bey<br />
          I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens<br />
          And spike yourself esteem<br /><br />

          The new james bond gon' be black as me<br />
          Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea<br />
          And it's all beautiful to me<br />
          Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens<br />
          We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain't a thing<br />
          Barefoot babies with no cares<br />
          Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car?<br />
          I don't see compton, I see something much worse<br />
          The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth<br />
