          How much a dollar really cost?<br />
          The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts<br />
          Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all<br />
          Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car<br />
          Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo<br />
          20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo<br />
          20 years ago, can't forget<br /><br />

          Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals<br />
          Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do<br />
          20 on 6, he didn't hear me<br />
          Indigenous African only spoke Zulu<br />
          My American tongue was slurry<br />
          Walked out the gas station<br />
          A homeless man with a silly tan complexion<br />
          Asked me for ten grand<br /><br />

          Stressin' about dry land<br />
          Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open<br />
          A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'<br />
          He begged and pleaded<br />
          Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it<br />
          Told him: Beat it<br />
          Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it<br />
          He said: My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated<br />
          Listen to me, I want a single bill from you<br />
          Nothin' less, nothin' more<br />
          I told him I ain't have it and closed my door<br />
          Tell me how much a dollar cost<br /><br />

          It's more to feed your mind<br />
          Water, sun and love, the one you love<br />
          All you need, the air you breathe<br /><br />

          He's starin' at me in disbelief<br />
          My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key<br />
          He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave<br />
          And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see<br />
          The reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save
          him<br />
          Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor<br />
          He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser<br />
          He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious<br />
          Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect<br />
          If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck<br />
          I never understood someone beggin' for goods<br />
          Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could<br />
          And this particular person just had it down pat<br />
          Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked<br />
          Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?<br />
          A humble man is all that we ever need<br />
          Tell me how much a dollar cost<br /><br />

          It's more to feed your mind<br />
          Water, sun and love, the one you love<br />
          All you need, the air you breathe<br /><br />

          Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment<br />
          I never met a transient that demanded attention<br />
          They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'<br />
          Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different<br />
          I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless<br />
          My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?<br />
          So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies<br />
          I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the
          time<br />
          I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'<br />
          Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise<br /><br />

          Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine<br />
          Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin<br />
          Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin'<br />
          Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal<br />
          Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is
          up<br />
          I seen you from a mile away losin' focus<br />
          And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy<br />
          You looked at me and said: Your potential is bittersweet<br />
          I looked at him and said: Every nickel is mines to keep<br />
          He looked at me and said: Know the truth, it'll set you free<br />
          You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power<br />
          The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve<br />
          Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost<br />
          The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God<br /><br />

          I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?<br />
          Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be<br />
          Shades of grey will never change if I condone<br />
          Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs<br />
