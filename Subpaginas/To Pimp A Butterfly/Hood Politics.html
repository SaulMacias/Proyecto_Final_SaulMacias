          You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game<br />
          Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up<br /><br />

          Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up<br />
          Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock<br />
          It goes sherm sticks, burn this<br />
          Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix<br />
          50 Nigga salute, out the compton zoo, with the extras<br />
          El cos, monte carlos, road kings and dressers<br />
          Rip ridaz, p-funkers, mexicans, they fuck with you<br />

          14 Years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies<br />
          On the dead homies<br /><br />

          Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked<br />
          The little homies called, they said, the enemies done cliqued up<br />
          Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?<br />
          Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio<br />
          Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous<br />
          Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras<br />
          The lapd gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'<br /><br />

          Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer<br />
          The streets don't fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town<br />
          From compton to congress, set trippin' all around<br />
          Ain't nothin' new but a flow of new democrips and rebloodlicans<br />
          Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?<br />
          They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs<br />
          Make it they promise to fuck with you<br />
          No condom they fuck with you, obama say, what it do?<br /><br />

          I been a-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo<br />
          Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo<br />
          Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo<br />
          Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo<br />
          We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce<br />
          14 Years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies<br />
          On the dead homies<br /><br />

          Everybody want to talk about who this and who that<br />
          Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black<br />
          Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin'<br />
          Motherfucker if you did, then killer mike'd be platinum<br />
          Y'all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit<br />
          Hennessy and crown vic, my memory been gone since<br />
          Don't ask about no camera back at award shows<br />
          No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my foes<br />
          'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it<br /><br />

          I'm the only nigga next to snoop that can push the button<br />
          Had the coast on standby<br />
          K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up pandora's box<br />
          I box 'em all in, by a landslide<br />
          Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets<br />
          I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats<br />
          But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with jay<br />
          He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"<br />
          I been a-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo!<br /><br />

          I remember you was conflicted<br />
          Misusing your influence<br />
          Sometimes I did the same<br />
          Abusing my power full of resentment<br />
          Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br />
          Found myself screaming in a hotel room<br />
          I didn't want to self-destruct<br />
          The evils of lucy was all around me<br />
          So I went running for answers<br /><br />

          Until I came home<br />
          But that didn't stop survivors guilt<br />
          Going back and forth<br />
          Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned<br />
          Or maybe how a-1 my foundation was<br />
          But while my loved ones was fighting<br />
          A continuous war back in the city<br />
          I was entering a new one<br />
