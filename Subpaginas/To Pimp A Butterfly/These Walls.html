        <p>
          I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence<br />
          Sometimes, I did the same<br />
          If these walls could talk<br /><br />

          Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway<br />
          If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out<br />
          Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say
          hey<br />
          Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play<br />
          And she plays only when you tell her no<br /><br />

          If these walls could talk<br />
          I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you<br />
          If these walls could talk<br />
          I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it<br /><br />

          If these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good<br />
          No boat I float better than he would<br />
          No life jacket I'm not the guard in Nazareth<br />
          But your flood can be misunderstood<br />
          Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment<br />
          Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension<br />
          Me? I'm just a tenant<br />
          My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute<br />
          These walls are vulnerable, exclamation<br />
          Interior pink, color coordinated<br />
          I interrogated every nook and cranny<br />
          I mean its still amazing before they couldn't stand me<br />
          These walls want to cry tears<br />
          These walls happier when I'm here<br />
          These walls never could hold up<br />
          Every time I come around demolition might crush<br /><br />

          If these walls could talk<br />
          I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you<br />
          If these walls could talk<br />
          I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it<br /><br />

          If these walls could talk they'd tell me to go deep<br />
          Yelling at me continuously I can see<br />
          Your defense mechanism is my decision<br />
          Knock these walls down that's my religion<br />
          Walls feeling like they ready to close in<br />
          I suffocate then catch my second wind<br />
          I resonate in these walls<br />
          I don't know how long I can wait in these walls<br />
          I've been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside
          in<br />
          They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the
          cleanest<br />
          I beg to differ, I must've missed them<br />
          I'm not involved I'd rather diss them<br />
          I'd rather call all you put your wall up<br />
          'Cause when I come around demolition gon' crush<br /><br />

          If these walls could talk<br />
          I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you<br />
          If these walls could talk<br />
          I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it<br /><br />

          If your walls could talk they'd tell you it's too late<br />
          Your destiny accepted your fate<br />
          Burn accessories and stash them where they are<br />
          Take the recipe, the bible and God<br />
          Wall telling you that commissary is low<br />
          Race wars happening no calling CO<br />
          No calling your mother to save you<br />
          Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable<br />
          Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch<br />
          Walls is telling me you a bitch<br />
          You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them<br />
          That sentence so important<br />
          Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me<br />
          Retaliation is strong you even dream about me<br />
          Killed my homeboy and God spared your life<br />
          Dumb criminal got indicted the same night<br />
          So when you play this song rewind the first verse<br />
          About me abusing my power so you can hurt<br />
          About me and her in the shower whenever she horny<br />
          About me and her in the after hours of the morning<br />
          About her baby daddy currently serving life<br />
          And how she think about you until we meet up at night<br />
          About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her<br />
          And how she fucking on a famous rapper<br />
          Walls could talk<br /><br />

          I remember you was conflicted<br />
          Misusing your influence<br />
          Sometimes I did the same<br />
          Abusing my power full of resentment<br />
          Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br />
          Found myself screaming in a hotel room<br />
