          Whats wrong nigga?<br />
          I thought you was keeping it gangsta?<br />
          I thought this what you wanted?<br />
          They say if you scared go to church<br />
          But remember<br />
          He knows the bible too<br /><br />

          My baby when I get you get you get you get you<br />
          Ima hit the throttle with you<br />
          Smoking lokin' poking the doja till I'm idle with you<br />
          Cause I (want you)<br />
          Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty<br />
          Registration is out of service<br />
          Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving<br />
          Cause I (want you)<br />
          I want you more than you know<br /><br />

          I remember you took me to the mall last week baby<br />
          You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times<br />
          Till I was hypnotized then you clarified<br />
          That I (want you)<br />
          You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy<br />
          I said you crazy<br />
          Roses are red violets are blue<br />
          But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)<br /><br />

          My baby when I get you get you get you get you<br />
          Ima hit the throttle with you<br />
          Smoking lokin' poking the doja till I'm idle with you<br />
          Cause I (want you)<br />
          Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty<br />
          Registration is out of service<br />
          Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving<br />
          Cause I (want you)<br />
          I want you more than you know<br /><br />

          You said to me<br />
          You said your name was Lucy<br />
          I said where's Ricardo?<br />
          You said oh no, not the show<br />
          Than you spit a little rap to me like this<br />
          When I turned 26 I was like oh shit<br />
          You said this to me<br />
          I remember what you said too, you said<br />
          "My name is Lucy, Kendrick<br />
          You introduced me Kendrick<br />
          Usually I don't do this<br />
          But I see you and me Kendrick<br /><br />

          Lucy give you no worries<br />
          Lucy got million stories<br />
          About these rappers I came after when they was boring<br />
          Lucy gone fill your pockets<br />
          Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton<br />
          Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised<br />
          Lucy just want your trust and loyalty<br />
          Avoiding me?<br />
          It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly<br />
          Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute<br /><br />

          Lucy work harder<br />
          Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father<br />
          I'm Lucy<br />
          I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly<br />
          Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me<br />
          Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front<br />
          Lucy got paper work on top of paper work<br />
          I want you to know that Lucy got you<br />
          All your life I watched you<br />
          And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that's
          possible"<br /><br />

          My baby when I get you get you get you get you<br />
          Ima hit the throttle with you<br />
          Smoking lokin' poking the doja till I'm idle with you<br />
          Cause I (want you)<br />
          Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty<br />
          Registration is out of service<br />
          Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving<br />
          Cause I (want you)<br />
          I want you more than you know<br /><br />

          I remembered you was conflicted<br />
          Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same<br />
          Abusing my power full of resentment<br />
          Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br />
          Found myself screamin' in the hotel room<br />
          I didn't wanna self destruct<br />
          The evils of Lucy was all around me<br />
          So I went runnin' for answers<br />
          Until I came home<br />
