          That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say<br />
          You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May<br />
          But I know I'm gonna change that tune<br />
          When I'm back on top, back on top in June<br /><br />

          I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem<br />
          Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream<br />
          But I don't let it, let it get me down<br />
          'Cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around<br /><br />

          I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king<br />
          I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing<br />
          Each time I find myself flat on my face<br />
          I pick myself up and get back in the race<br /><br />

          That's life (that's life), I tell you I can't deny it<br />
          I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it<br />
          And if I didn't think it was worth one single try<br />
          I'd jump right on a big bird, and then I'd fly<br /><br />

          I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king<br />
          I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing<br />
          Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face<br />
          I just pick myself up and get back in the race<br /><br />

          That's life (that's life), that's life and I can't deny it<br />
          Many times I thought of cuttin' out, but my heart won't buy it<br />
          But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July<br />
          I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die<br /><br />

          My, my!<br />
