        <p>
          When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar<br />
          I definitely wanted to become a musician<br />
          It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big<br />
          That I didn't see any chance because<br />
          I was living in a little town; was studying<br />
          And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician<br />
          I thought: Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance<br />
          Because all I really wanted to do is music<br />
          And not only play music, but compose music<br /><br />

          At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already
          discotheques<br />
          So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque<br />
          Sing maybe thirty minutes<br />
          I think I had about seven, eight songs<br />
          I would partially sleep in the car<br />
          Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about<br />
          Almost two years to survive in the beginning<br />
          I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s<br />
          The sounds of the '60s, of the '70s<br />
          And then have a sound of the future<br />
          And I said: Wait a second, I know the synthesizer<br />
          Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?<br />
          And I didn't have any idea what to do<br />
          But I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track<br />
          Which then was synced to the Moog Modular<br />
          I knew that could be a sound of the future<br />
          But I didn't realize how much the impact would be<br /><br />

          My name is Giovanni Giorgio<br />
          But everybody calls me Giorgio<br /><br />

          Once you free your mind about a concept of<br />
          Harmony and of music being correct<br />
          You can do whatever you want<br />
          So, nobody told me what to do<br />
          And there was no preconception of what to do<br />
