          Driving this road down to paradise<br />
          Letting the sunlight into my eyes<br />
          Our only plan is to improvise<br />
          And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end<br />
          If I had my way, I would never leave<br />
          Keep building these random memories<br />
          Turning our days into melodies<br />
          But since I can't stay<br /><br />

          I'll just keep playing back<br />
          These fragments of time<br />
          Everywhere I go<br />
          These moments will shine<br />
          I'll just keep playing back<br />
          These fragments of time<br />
          Everywhere I go<br />
          These moments will shine<br /><br />

          Familiar faces I've never seen<br />
          Living the gold and the silver dream<br />
          Making me feel like I'm seventeen<br />
          And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end<br />
          If I had my way, I would never leave<br />
          Keep building these random memories<br />
          Turning our days into melodies<br />
          But since I can't stay<br /><br />
