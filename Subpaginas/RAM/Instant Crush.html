          I didn't want to be the one to forget<br />
          I thought of everything I'd never regret<br />
          A little time with you is all that I get<br />
          That's all we need, because it's all we can take<br />
          One thing I never see the same when your 'round<br />
          I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground<br />
          I wanna take you to that place in the Roche<br />
          But no one gives us any time anymore<br /><br />

          He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog<br />
          You made an offer for it, then you ran off<br />
          I got this picture of us kids in my head<br />
          And all I hear is the last thing that you said<br />
          I listened to your problems, now listen to mine<br />
          I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh<br /><br />

          And we will never be alone again<br />
          'Cause it doesn't happen every day<br />
          Kinda counted on you being a friend<br />
          Can I give it up or give it away?<br />
          Now I thought about what I wanna say<br />
          But I never really know where to go<br />
          So I chained myself to a friend<br />
          'Cause I know it unlocks like a door<br /><br />

          And we will never be alone again<br />
          'Cause it doesn't happen every day<br />

          So I chained myself to a friend<br />
          Some more again<br /><br />

          It didn't matter what they wanted to see<br />
          He thought he saw someone that looked just like me<br />
          The summer memory that just never dies<br />
          We worked too long and hard to give it no time<br />
          He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies<br />
          Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise<br />
          He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall<br />
          He cannot break it down or else he would fall<br /><br />

          One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold<br />
          Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore<br /><br />

          I listened to your problems, now listen to mine<br />
          I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh<br /><br />

          And we will never be alone again<br />

          I don't understand, don't get upset, I'm not with you<br />
          We're swimming around, it's all I do when I'm with you<br /><br />
