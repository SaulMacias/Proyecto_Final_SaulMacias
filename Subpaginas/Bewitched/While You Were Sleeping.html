        <p>
          I still can't believe that you noticed me an ocean away<br />
          The heavens would say it was meant to be<br />
          I'll never forget the first time I saw you then<br />
          Primrose at three, you had all of me<br />
          Without saying a word<br /><br />

          I don't recognize myself<br />
          I'm dancing down streets<br />
          Smiling to strangers<br />
          Idiotic things<br />
          I trace it all back, 3: 30 am<br />
          That night, something turned in my heart<br />
          While you were sleeping, I fell in love<br /><br />

          I can't quite believe you think I'm beautiful<br />
          Must be a trick, a: Tag and you're it, kind of foolery<br />
          Then you take my hand, kiss me on the cheek<br />
          A light pink bouquet, a promise you'll stay<br />
          And I start to believe<br /><br />

          I don't recognize myself<br />
          I'm writing a love song<br />
          Who've I become?<br />
          There must be something wrong<br />
          I trace it all back, 3:30 am<br />
          That night, something turned in my heart<br />
          While you were sleeping, I fell in love<br />
