          Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair<br />
          Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere<br />
          Voices echo in the gym<br />
          Another girl's had her first kiss<br />
          Please, don't think too much of it, darling<br /><br />

          I'm so sorry that they pick you last<br />
          Try to say your foreign name and laugh<br />
          I know that you feel loud, so different from the crowd<br />
          Of big blue eyes, and long blonde hair, and boys that stare<br />
          But, baby, know that<br /><br />

          You'll grow up<br />
          And grow so tough and charm them<br />
          Write your story, fall in love a little too<br />
          The things you thought you'd never do<br />
          I wish I could go back and give her a squeeze<br />
          Myself at 13<br />
          And just let her know, know that she's beautiful<br /><br />

          Keep on going with your silly dream<br />
          Life is prettier than it may seem<br />
          One day, you'll be up on stage<br />
          Little girls will scream your name<br />
          The days of tears and failure fears<br />
          And no one cares, will all make sense, 'cause<br /><br />

          You'll grow up<br />
          And grow so confident, and<br />
          Write your story, fall in love a little too<br />
          The things you thought you'd never do<br />
          I wish I could go back and give her a squeeze<br />
          Myself at 13<br />
          And just let her know, know that she's beautiful<br /><br />

          Ooh-ooh<br />
