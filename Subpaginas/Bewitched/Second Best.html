          I'll never forget how stupid in love I felt<br />
          I'll always regret how I couldn't ever tell<br />
          That you walked a little faster, left me behind<br />
          Kissed me with somebody else in mind<br />
          I loved you so much<br />
          That I settled for less<br /><br />

          Oh, you were my everything<br />
          I was your second best<br /><br />

          Lying awake, I'd watch as you'd dream at night (dream at night)<br />
          Nightingale singing half-hearted lullabies<br />
          Well, you swing me around in that midsummer dance<br />
          Held me in close as you thought of your past<br />
          I love way too much<br />
          Oh, this hurts to confess<br /><br />

          Oh, you were my everything<br />
          I was your second best<br /><br />

          You've given me nothing to miss<br />
          Honestly, life has been much better since<br />
          I spoke to you last<br />
          Why am I still wondering<br />
          If I stand a chance or if you'd have me back?<br /><br />

          Everyone warned me you were a bad idea<br />
          I never listen<br />
          Maybe I will next year<br />
          When I've walked a little further into my life<br />
          Fallen in love and left you behind<br />
          But I'm still a little in love with this mess<br /><br />

          Oh, you were my everything<br />
          I'm just your second best<br /><br />

          Mm<br />
          Second best<br />
